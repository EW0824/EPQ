# EPQ - Extended Project Qualification (Artefact)

'bball_project_new' contains the flask web application which the CNN model will be hosted on. The CNN model is still under development and in repo: Machine Learning.


'ML Resources' includes some other similar projects, from the internet, which could be of reference. 

This project served as my introduction into ML/DL and took place between 11/2020 to sometime in 4/2021. The project was put on hold when I started working on the medical imaging. It will be revived soon, after I learn enough about swift to be able to transform this into an ios app.
